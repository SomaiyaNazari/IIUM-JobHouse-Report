1 INTRODUCTION
IIUM Job House is a native mobile application that helps the owners of shops, cafes and restaurants within IIUM to find employees who are willing to work. This application also enables job seekers to search for whether part or full time job vacancies in the shops, cafes, restaurants and photocopy centres within IIUM. The main purpose of this application is to be a mean of connection between job providers and job seekers.

2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
2.1 Background of the problem
The developers plan to develop a native mobile application that can be used in IIUM and by IIUM students, staffs, and owners of shops, cafes, restaurants, photocopy centres. Currently, job providers are advertising job availability on social media and manually and also job seekers visit job providers manually for job vacancy. 
Besides, there is no such specific job platform to be a mean of connection between job seekers and job providers in IIUM. Existing businesses in IIUM are not such big companies to be registered in existing applications such as Indeed, JobStreet and JobStore and advertise their job vacancies. Therefore, the developer team came out with the idea of IIUM Job House.

•	The available applications do not advertise specific jobs in IIUM ‘s canteens, cafés, shops and photocopy centres.
